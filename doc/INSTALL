== 1. eZPublish settings ==

@hint You might need to change your DefaultAccess to 'ezwebin_site' in settings/override/site.ini.append.php 
For example, in my standard installation, it was 'eng'. 

=== settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site/site.ini.append.php ===
[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveAccessExtensions[]=hwboot

[DesignSettings]
SiteDesign=hwboot
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezwebin
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base

=== settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site/image.ini.append.php ===
[ImageMagick]
Filters[]=geometry/fill=-resize %1x%2^ -gravity center -extent %1x%2

[listitem]
Reference=
Filters[]
Filters[]=geometry/fill=140;100

== 2. eZ Less ==

=== Install and activate ezless extension ===
